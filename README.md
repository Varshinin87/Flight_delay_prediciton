# United Airlines Flight Delay Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting flight delays for United Airlines using machine learning algorithms. Flight delays can be frustrating for passengers, and this predictive model can help travelers plan their trips more effectively. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

## Introduction

Airline flight delays can be caused by various factors such as weather conditions, air traffic, and maintenance issues. Predicting these delays can be beneficial for both travelers and airlines. In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict flight delays for United Airlines based on historical data.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical flight data for United Airlines. It includes features such as departure airport, arrival airport, scheduled departure time, actual departure time, and more. The target variable is the delay status (delayed or not delayed).

You can obtain the dataset from United airlines website or Kaggle  

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/united-airlines-flight-delay-prediction.git
cd united-airlines-flight-delay-prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `united_airlines_flight_delay_prediction.ipynb` to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the machine learning model, and make predictions.

3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to run each code cell step by step.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of the flight delay prediction model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can find the model evaluation results in the Jupyter Notebook.
